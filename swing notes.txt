Three types of threads:
Initial: threads that run at the start
Event Dispatch: All event handling code is executed here. Most code interacting with Swing also executes here
Worker: Background tasks executed

INITIAL:
For swing, the initial thread should just create a runnable object initializing the GUI and scheduling execution for the GUI on the event threads.
How to create GUI: Use javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater or javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait. For non-applets (not connecting to the web), both can be used. 

EVENT DISPATCH:
For "thread-safe" Swing methods, you can invoke these methods in any thread, but for non-thread-safe methods they can only be invoked in event thread.
Quick way to see if you're on the event thread: invoke javax.swing.SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread.
