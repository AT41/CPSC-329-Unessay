Three types of threads:
Initial: threads that run at the start
Event Dispatch: All event handling code is executed here. Most code interacting with Swing also executes here
Worker: Background tasks executed

INITIAL:
For swing, the initial thread should just create a runnable object initializing the GUI and scheduling execution for the GUI on the event threads.
How to create GUI: Use javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater or javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait. For non-applets (not connecting to the web), both can be used. 

EVENT DISPATCH:
For "thread-safe" Swing methods, you can invoke these methods in any thread, but for non-thread-safe methods they can only be invoked in event thread.
Quick way to see if you're on the event thread: invoke javax.swing.SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread.

WORKER:
Created using SwingWorker classes. Provides a way to return values when finished, as well as provide intermediate results (which get processed in event threads)

TODO ANTHONY We can consider making new SwingWorker classes for all our different attacks, but I don't think that solves our current issue since all our things are processed in the event thread already.





TODO Add the slider/input box to let user choose how many guesses are ran per second
TODO Fix "additional stats" to have text naturally break
